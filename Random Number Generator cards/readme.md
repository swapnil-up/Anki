# What's the point?

You could think of anki as a simple 'remember a fact' system but that'd be reducing it's amazing qualities. By creating 5 cards that allow for practise of applying quick math to solve the squares we are able to train our brain to focus not on building a cache of all of those numbers, but instead learning how to quickly calculate any of those numbers.

Instead of creating an N-cache that is too costly, we are able to replace with a slightly more non-trivial calculation that is processed everytime. As an analogy: instead of learning to incrementally add 5 a 100 times, we are learning to multiply 5 and 100.


# How was this built?

Credit goes to a redditor who already built this for his purpose of generating and solving quadractic equations.

A key player within the card is anki-persistence which allows for the values to be the same on the front and the back. 


# What will I use it for?

Generate problems for different types of quick math tricks such as multiply by 11 and square any number. 


# Possible changes could include:
	- [ ] Add a 10 second timer after which even answering the cards is considered a fail and need to do tomorrow. Reduce time as needed.
