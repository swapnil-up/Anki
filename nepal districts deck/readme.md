# What is this?

A deck to quickly learn the different districts and their positions on the map of Nepal. 

Connections are made two way i.e. you learn to both point the district on the map, and name the district currently highlighted. 


# Why make this?

It's a good way to learn about some fundamental geography of the country, that is useful during daily life as well.


# How did you make it?

There was a quick workflow that made this quite fast to make. 

### Prep:
	1. open the add card editor in anki and select basic and reversed.
	2. open mtpaint (or any other paint app that you prefer) 
	3. copy the image that you wish to use (here an empty map template from wikimedia commons) into the clipboard.
	4. paste a copy of the empty map on the back side.
	
### During:
	1. Use the fill color option to color a district
	2. hit ctrl+s on the keyboard.
	3. press ctrl+v in the anki editor. This pastes the just saved image into the editor
	4. hit tab and enter the name of the district (helpful to have a labelled map if you don't know the districts by heart :P)
	5. Hit ctrl+enter
	6. Press ctrl+z in mtpaint to get the empty map
	7. repeat from step 1.
